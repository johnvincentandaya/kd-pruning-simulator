- Optimize image sizes for mobile screens

### 2. Code Splitting
- Implement React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Minimize bundle size for mobile networks

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Use browser caching for static assets
- Cache API responses appropriately

## Accessibility Features

### 1. Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Proper tab order throughout the application
- Focus indicators for keyboard users

### 2. Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Alt text for images and icons

### 3. Color and Contrast
- WCAG AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Color is not the only way to convey information
- High contrast mode support

## Mobile-Specific Features

### 1. Touch Gestures
- Swipe navigation between pages
- Pinch-to-zoom for 3D visualization
- Long-press for context menus

### 2. Device Orientation
- Support for both portrait and landscape modes
- Responsive layout adjustments
- 3D visualization adapts to orientation changes

### 3. Mobile-Specific UI Patterns
- Bottom navigation for primary actions
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Infinite scroll for long lists

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Core Web Vitals
Monitor these metrics on mobile:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### 2. Mobile-Specific Metrics
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Mobile PageSpeed Insights score

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. HTTPS Requirement
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for PWA features
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

### 2. Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Implement service worker
- Add web app manifest
- Enable offline functionality

### 3. CDN and Caching
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement proper caching headers
- Optimize for mobile network conditions

## Troubleshooting Common Mobile Issues

### 1. Touch Events Not Working
- Ensure proper touch event handling
- Check for CSS pointer-events conflicts
- Verify z-index stacking contexts

### 2. 3D Visualization Performance
- Reduce polygon count on mobile
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) system
- Use lower resolution textures

### 3. Layout Issues
- Check for fixed widths that don't scale
- Verify flexbox and grid compatibility
- Test with different zoom levels

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles
